My first step will be to google things like:

jQuery basics
jQuery quick guide
jQuery hello world
jQuery cheat sheet

I like to start by getting a lot of the basics right away, and then moving on to more advanced stuff later.

Once I've got a simple jQuery demonstration up and running, I'll take a little break.

Then I'll check google for some intermediate projects involving jQuery, to try some more practical projects. This will also put me face-to-face with some jQuery functions I've never seen before, which I can then google to fill in any gaps in my understanding. I think this is the best way to avoid a lot of overlapping lessons and reiteration of programming concepts that I'm already familiar with.

My plan worked pretty well, although there was more googling than I had expected. Looking for a 'hello world' implementation was the best of my ideas - it got me up and running right away, and I was able to swap out that simple function with more advanced stuff.
