You've joined two tables before. How do you join three?

Input:
SELECT * FROM reviews JOIN businesses JOIN users ON reviews.business_id = businesses.id AND reviews.user_id = users.id;

Output
1|5|Great shopping experience!|1|1|1|Target|1|Jerry|Seinfeld
2|4|Not enough donuts|3|2|3|K-Mart|2|Homer|Simpson
3|2|Awful shopping experience|2|3|2|Wal-Mart|3|Stewie|Griffin

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There are some repetitive columns if we choose to view all fields. 
Choose instead to just view the user's names, the business name, the star rating, and the comment.

SELECT businesses.name, users.first_name, users.last_name, reviews.stars, reviews.comment 
FROM reviews JOIN businesses JOIN users ON reviews.business_id = businesses.id AND reviews.user_id = users.id;

How do you view the data of all three tables for just one particular business?
